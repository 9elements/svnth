# SVNTH

I'm trying to implement a polyphonic synthesizer in Rust. I'm new to Audio Engineering and also to Rust so please forgive bad coding style and incorrect math.

## Repositories that I've learned from

- RustAduio
  - General Architecture [Synth](https://github.com/RustAudio/synth)
  - [VCF Filter](https://github.com/rsta2/minisynth/blob/master/src/filter.cpp)
